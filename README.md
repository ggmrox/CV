CV Project
===========================

This project contains a template for my professional Curriculum Vitae (Gabriel Maldaner), 
built entirely with pure HTML and CSS. 
It is optimized for high-quality A4 printing and PDF export.

The goal is to make and maintain a professional, responsive, and ATS-friendly CV without relying 
on .doc/.docx processors or heavy design tools, giving full control over formatting and layout.

Also, to host it online, so that makes it easier to update and edit as needed.
